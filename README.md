# Hello!

Enhancers are DNA regulatory elements that control cell-type specific gene expression and are crucial for organism development. Despite their importance, we do not have a good understanding of how this function is encoded into the enhancer DNA sequence. My research focuses on using machine learning, along with comparative genomics and genome evolution to learn the enhancer sequence code.
